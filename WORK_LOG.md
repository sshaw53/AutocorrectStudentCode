| March 12 |  2:30-4:30pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Today, I figured out how to implement the Levenschtein distance algorithm. I had a ton of trouble figuring out how to sort by smallest distance and then alphabet, so that was really confusing. I had to use a ton of if and while statements to solve this aspect and a ton of debugging and trial & error, but now I have a working solution. Excited to work next class on a faster, more personalized way of sorting through these words. |
| March 14 | 10:45-11:15am |                                                                                                     I talked with Mr. Blick about different ways to shorten the dictionary choices. We talked about a concept that included taking each combo of n-letters of the identified word, hashing it, and looking at the index of the hashes in an array full of ArrayLists of words that is pre-constructed. The hashed array of ArrayLists of words will be constructed before - it would require finding a way to use a sliding window to hash each section of n-letters of each word in the dictionary, and then prevent adding that word to any other indexes in the array of ArrayLists to avoid duplicates. I'm trying to think through how this could work. |
| March 16 |   8-8:30pm    |                                                                                    I didn't have much time this weekend to work on the pset, but I spent my time mapping out on a whiteboard how I think this structure could be made for the hashes of words of dictionaries. I want to use a polynomial rolling hash function to prevent rehashing every single time a letter is taken off and a new one is added so I could use the window method, I'm also ideating what size would be beneficial for my structure. Also, I'm thinking of making some sort of boolean array that would track whether the word has already been inputted in the array to prevent overlap but not entirely sure yet bc it may not work and it could lack space-efficiency. |
| March 18 | 10:55-11:55am | During class today, I talked with Mr. Blick and Cody about the approach we discussed earlier. I added to my original plan, and I think I want to sort dictionary words by length as well but I want to find a space-efficient way to do that. I'm hoping that would cut down the time because I would look for words that fall in a given length range that also have n-grams with the word - but I'm worried about space. Also, instead of creating a boolean array to avoid overlaps, I talked with Mr. Blick about creating a hash set to avoid the duplicates in my list of words. Mr. Blick also shared his approach of using a trie which I found super interesting, so if my plan doesn't work, I'll probably try to implement that solution instead. |

I debugged with Mr. Blick and realized I was comparing to the dictionary rather than comparing to the filtered set of words that I created. I also debugged my way through organizing the list correctly. |

| March 23 | 12:15-2:05pm  |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               I tried to use ngram tokenization when there were 4+ letters in a word, but just filter by length if less than 4 letters, and tried to implement the terminal part as well but I'm getting quite lost and it's not working. I also want to try to find an efficient way to only add the words from filtered that are within the correct lengths to then look for lev distance. |

Given an extension to clean up code, write a readMe, and try to change my nGram value based on the length of the typed word. |
