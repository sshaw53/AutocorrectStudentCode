| March 12 | 2:30-4:30pm | Today, I figured out how to implement the Levenschtein distance algorithm. I had a ton of trouble figuring out how to sort by smallest distance and then alphabet, so that was really confusing. I had to use a ton of if and while statements to solve this aspect and a ton of debugging and trial & error, but now I have a working solution. Excited to work next class on a faster, more personalized way of sorting through these words. |
